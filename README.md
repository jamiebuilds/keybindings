# `tinykeys`

> A tiny (~400 B) & modern library for keybindings.

## Install

```sh
npm install --save tinykeys
```

## Usage

```js
import tinykeys from "tinykeys"

tinykeys(window, {
  "Shift+D": () => {
    alert("The 'Shift' and 'd' keys were pressed at the same time")
  },
  "y e e t": () => {
    alert("The keys 'y', 'e', 'e', and 't' were pressed in order")
  },
  "$mod+KeyD": () => {
    alert("Either 'Control+d' or 'Meta+d' were pressed")
  },
})
```

## Keybinding Syntax

Keybindings are made up of a **_sequence_** of **_presses_**.

A **_press_** can be as simple as a single **_key_** which matches against
[`KeyboardEvent.code`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/code/code_values)
and
[`KeyboardEvent.key`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key)
(case-insensitive).

```js
// Matches `event.key`:
"d"
// Matches: `event.code`:
"KeyD"
```

Presses can optionally be prefixed with **_modifiers_** which match against any
valid value to
[`KeyboardEvent.getModifierState()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/getModifierState).

```js
"Control+d"
"Meta+d"
"Shift+D"
"Alt+KeyD"
"Meta+Shift+D"
```

There is also a special `$mod` modifier that makes it easy to support cross
platform keybindings:

- Mac: `$mod` = `Meta` (âŒ˜)
- Windows/Linux: `$mod` = `Control`

```js
"$mod+D" // Meta/Control+D
"$mod+Shift+D" // Meta/Control+Shift+D
```

### Keybinding Sequences

Keybindings can also consist of several key presses in a row:

```js
"g i" // i.e. "Go to Inbox"
"g a" // i.e. "Go to Archive"
"ArrowUp ArrowUp ArrowDown ArrowDown ArrowLeft ArrowRight ArrowLeft ArrowRight B A"
```

Each press can optionally be prefixed with modifier keys:

```js
"$mod+K $mod+1" // i.e. "Toggle Level 1"
"$mod+K $mod+2" // i.e. "Toggle Level 2"
"$mod+K $mod+3" // i.e. "Toggle Level 3"
```

Each press in the sequence must be pressed within 1000ms of the last.
